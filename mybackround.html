<p><h2><b> Freshman Aspirations </b></h2></p>

<p><body> I started off my young athletic career like any other kid in my town, soccer. I played for a couple of years and I just came to the realization that it isn't for me. I then transitioned into my football phase which consisted of an amazing one year. After I discovered baseball, which came to be my favorite sport. I paved my yellow brick road for future acolades. Years flew by and Baseball grew deeper and deeper into my life and I was officaly addicted. 6th grade rolled around and trajedy struck. I learned that I had a tumor in my jaw and that I would have to endure multiple invasive surgeries to repair it. After this hardship I turned to the one sport that I was cleared to play, golf.</body></p>

<p><h2><b> Young Success </b></h2></p>

<p><body> When 8th grade ended, I had to decide on two sports that I would continue in my highschool career. I chose golf and baseball, which was not a hard decesion. In the summer between junior high and Highschool I practiced golf every day and hoaned my skills as a young golfer. I also made sure to keep up on my baseball skills because that was coming up in the spring. When it came towards the end of the summer and we had golf tryouts, I was very prepared and excited because I knew that I could make a name for myself on the team.</body></p>

<p><h2> Teamates </h2></p>

<p><body> I have always thought of myself as a team player which has given me an advantage towards team bonding and those kind of concepts. My teamates are always very accepting and encouraging to be because we all share that team bond together which is huge when it comes to athletic success.
