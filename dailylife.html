<p><H2><p> Routine </b><H2></p>
<p> Every day I would wake up, eat a healthy breakfast and head over to school. After classes I would go to the gym where I would lift weights and run. My key component to getting in proper shape for the upcoming seasons was to eat right. This was something my coach stressed to us because we needed to be in tip top shape. I know that cardio isn't fun but its just something you have to do to get in shape to compete.
	<p><H2><b> What I Ate </b></H2></p>
	<p> My main diest consisted of eating a strong breakfast with a good load of carbs to get me ready for the day. Then for lunch I would have a high protein option with some carbs for the gym after. After the gym I would have some kind of protein shake and also drink a lot of milk to provide my body with what it needs.
