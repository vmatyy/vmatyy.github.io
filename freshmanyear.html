<p> My freshman year consisted of playing golf in the fall and baseball in the spring. I had an absolute blast because I was always with my friends and I could better myself as a student athlete. I earned captainship in golf and was working my way up the ranks in basbeall.

<p> I started off the season by playing really well, and I earned our conference title of MVP. Every practice I would show up with a can do attitude and I was willing to put everything out there to get better at my craft. By the end of the year, our team made it to states and we were faced with the other great teams and individual players.

<p> My freshman year of baseball was very eventful because of the dramatic events that ended our season. We were competing for our county's champiosnhip and we were playing against a team who was bigger better and faster than us. But we didn't make any different gameplans that would of changed our success. We stuck with what we knew and we ended up winning in extra innings which boosted our morale.
